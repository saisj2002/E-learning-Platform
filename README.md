enabling users to upload various types of learning materials, track content usage, and
automatically generate progress reports based on student engagement.
The assessment module of the system enables instructors to manage the evaluation
process from quiz creation to grading. It allows for the creation and management
of assessment questions, tracking of student submissions, and generation
of performance reports. Additionally, it provides analytics capabilities to analyse
learning outcomes, student trends, and course effectiveness. Furthermore, the system
incorporates user management features, such as role-based access control, profile
management, and communication tools, to ensure secure and efficient platform
operation. The platform also includes payment processing capabilities for course
subscriptions and premium content access, integrated with secure payment gateways.
The system is built with scalability and security in mind, utilizing modern technologies
and following best practices in software development. It includes comprehensive
testing strategies to ensure reliability and performance, with features for both automated
and manual testing processes. This E-learning Platform represents a complete solution
